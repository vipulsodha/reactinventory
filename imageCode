Firstly, I grab my image with getElementByID and save the image as a Base64. Then I save the Base64 string as my localStorage value.

bannerImage = document.getElementById('bannerImg');
imgData = getBase64Image(bannerImage);
localStorage.setItem("imgData", imgData);
Here is the function that converts the image to a Base64 sting:

function getBase64Image(img) {
    var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
    canvas.width = img.width;
    canvas.height = img.height;

    var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
    ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0);

    var dataURL = canvas.toDataURL("image/png");

    return dataURL.replace(/^data:image\/(png|jpg);base64,/, "");
}
Then, on my next page I created an image with a blank src like so:

<img src="" id="tableBanner" />
And straight when the page loads, I use these next three lines to get the base64 string from localstorage and apply it to the image with the blank src I created:

var dataImage = localStorage.getItem('imgData');
bannerImg = document.getElementById('tableBanner');
bannerImg.src = "data:image/png;base64," + dataImage;
Tested it in quite a few different browsers and versions and it seems to work quite well.
